<b>Otsukare</b> (good work) is a language learning game designed to help you become more confident speaking in Japanese.
<p> You play the role of Kimio, a hard working character that must repay his families debts! Join Kimio as you search for work, complete tasks and reunite with family members.
<p>

This app is designed to be a complement to the popular language learning app <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>. We encourage you to practice there and fight for freedom here! This app is designed to be spoken/comprehension based and put you in real world situations helping you to understand:<p>

<ul>
<li>Meeting people
<li>Times and dates
<li>Directions and navigation
<li>Paying for items
</ul>

Our hope is that you become more comfortable speaking Japanese, and help Kimio rescue his family!
